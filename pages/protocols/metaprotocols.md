Metaprotocols are documents consisting of recommendations and best practices collected from the participating organizations and are associated with coarser granularity steps in TasCu. They provide advice on how to adapt Protocols to specific cases, how to decide which alternative or optional tasks to include, and how to determine the number of iterations needed in a particular case. Metaprotocols are written for project managers to help them select the right actionable content to include in the project.
Protocols and Metaprotocols are associated with different levels of TasCu. The steps at the finest level of granularity are associated with one or more Protocols. The steps at coarser levels of granularity are associated with Metaprotocols covering finer granularity level steps.

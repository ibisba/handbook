This page explains what a metaprotocol is and where they are used.

Metaprotocols are instructions consisting of recommendations and best practices that provide advice on how to choose what steps/tasks/modules/services to include in a project when the generic project template is being adapted for a particular project instance. The instructions may include a) how to adapt Protocols to specific cases, b) how to decide which alternative or optional tasks to include, and c) how to determine the number of iterations needed in a particular case. Metaprotocols are written for project managers to help them select the right actionable content to include in a specific project.

References to metaprotocols are found in TasCu, the generic project template/library. Contrary to Protocols, which are associated with the most detailed level of steps in TasCu, Metaprotocols are associated with steps at higher levels of granularity. There may be zero, one, or more metaprotocols associated with any specific TasCu step.

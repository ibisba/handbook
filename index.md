This is the IBISBA Handbook, a public information source for existing and new members of the IBISBA Enterprise. The Handbook contains practical instructions on how to operate IBISBA resources such as the IBISBA-Hub once the implementations and procedures are sufficiently stable for public dissemination. The Handbook also contains various guidelines <I>e.g.</I> for protocol writing and curation.

If you are unfamiliar with IBISBA, please wisit the <a href="https://www.ibisba.eu/">official website</a>. The IBISBA Enterprise is a joint undertaking to promote the establishment of a legal entity for operating a distributed European research infrastructure for industrial biotechnology by consortia including academic as well as industrial member organizations from many countries within the European Union. For more information about IBISBA, see the <a href="https://ibisba.eu/About">about section</a>.

Linking services provided by separate facilities into a single smooth service offering for clients form the basis for the uniqueness of IBISBA. This goal is pursued by multiple parallel approaches, including a) work packages within the EU-funded Horizon 2020 projects, b) a <a href="https://ibisba.github.io/handbook/tna_access.html">trans-national access programme</a>, c) cross-cutting taskforces on well-defined key topics, and d) stakeholder-activating working groups. In addition, the practical operations of TNA projects as well as other infrastructure access types relies on an <a href="https://ibisba.github.io/handbook/hub_introduction.html">asset and data sharing platform</a> enabling FAIR publishing, project management, and data management.

<a href="">IBISBA services</a> range from small fully-commercial analytical and omics services to all-inclusive CRO services and from research subcontracting to research collaboration partnerships. IBISBA focuses on Technology Readiness Levels from 2 to 7. The IBISBA research infrastructure and services serve both acedemic and industrial clients. Infrastructure access can be funded completely by the client or subsidized by a third party funding body.

IBISBA infrastructure accesses are managed and executed as projects. This handbook contains general guidelines and practical how-to instructions, including instructional videos, related to the different parts of the project life cycle and supporting sections for harmonization/standardization including <a href="https://ibisba.github.io/handbook/terminology.html">terminology</a>, protocols/metaprotocols, and workflows including automated computational workflows.
